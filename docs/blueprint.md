## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, calming blue (#64B5F6) to evoke trust and health. This references the health-themed request, without being overly clich√©. The saturation remains high enough to be visually pleasing, while working in a light-mode color scheme.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a very light tint of the primary color to create a calm, trustworthy background.
- Accent color: A gentle green (#A5D6A7) that suggests growth and well-being, analogous to the primary blue, and set apart through desaturation and brightness.
- Clean, readable sans-serif font for body text to ensure clarity and accessibility.
- Simple, consistent icons to represent different facility types and actions.
- Map-centric design with a clear call to action for finding nearby facilities.
